<pre>

There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array arr[]. You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating than their neighbors get more candies than their neighbors.
Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute.

Note: The answer will always fit into a 32-bit integer.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 0, 2]
Output: 5
Explanation: Children at index 0 and 2 will get 2 candies each as their rating is higher than index 1, and index 1 will get 1 candy. Thus total candies = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5.
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively. The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 109

class Solution:
    def minCandy(self, arr):
        lth=len(arr)
        c=[1]*lth
        for ix in range(1,lth):
            if arr[ix]>arr[ix-1] and c[ix]<=c[ix-1]:
                c[ix]=c[ix-1]+1
        for ix in range(lth-2,-1,-1):
            if arr[ix]>arr[ix+1] and c[ix]<=c[ix+1]:
                c[ix]=c[ix+1]+1
        return sum(c)
