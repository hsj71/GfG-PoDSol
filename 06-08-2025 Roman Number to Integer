## Roman Number to Integer

Given a string s in Roman number format, your task is to convert it to an integer. Various symbols and their values are given below.
Note: I = 1, V = 5, X = 10, L = 50, C = 100, D = 500, M = 1000

Examples:

Input: s = "IX"
Output: 9
Explanation: IX is a Roman symbol which represents 10 – 1 = 9.
Input: s = "XL"
Output: 40
Explanation: XL is a Roman symbol which represents 50 – 10 = 40.
Input: s = "MCMIV"
Output: 1904
Explanation: M is 1000, CM is 1000 – 100 = 900, and IV is 4. So we have total as 1000 + 900 + 4 = 1904.
Constraints:
1 ≤ roman number ≤ 3999
s[i] belongs to [I, V, X, L, C, D, M]

class Solution:
    def romanToDecimal(self, s): 
        roman = {
            'I': 1,
            'V': 5,
            'X': 10,
            'L': 50,
            'C': 100,
            'D': 500,
            'M': 1000
        }
        
        total = 0
        prev_value = 0
    
        for ch in reversed(s):
            curr_value = roman[ch]
            if curr_value < prev_value:
                total -= curr_value
            else:
                total += curr_value
            prev_value = curr_value
    
        return total
```
