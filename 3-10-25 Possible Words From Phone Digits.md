Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 52.79%Submissions: 83K+Points: 4Average Time: 20m

<pre>

You are given a keypad (as shown in the diagram) and an array arr[ ] containing digits, your task is to list all possible words in any order which can be generated by pressing numbers in arr[] sequentially.

Note: Number 0 and 1 do not map to any letters.
You can return the words in any order, the driver code will print them in sorted order.



Examples :

Input: arr[] = [2, 3]
Output: [ad, ae, af, bd, be, bf, cd, ce, cf]
Explanation: When we press 2 and 3 total 3 x 3 = 9 possible words formed.
Input: arr[] = [2]
Output: [a, b, c]
Explanation: When we press 2 total 3 possible words formed.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 9
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 9

class Solution:
    def possibleWords(self, arr):
        # code here
        from itertools import product
        
        m = {k: v for k, v in zip(range(2, 10), ["abc", "def", "ghi", "jkl", "mno", "pqrs", "tuv", "wxyz"])}
        return ["".join(e) for e in product(*[m[e] for e in arr if e in m])]
