## Find length of Loop

<pre>
Given the head of a linked list, determine whether the list contains a loop. If a loop is present, return the number of nodes in the loop, otherwise return 0.

Note: Internally, pos(1 based index) is used to denote the position of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. If pos = 0, it means the last node points to null, indicating there is no loop. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Examples:

Input: pos = 2,
   
Output: 4
Explanation: There exists a loop in the linked list and the length of the loop is 4.
Input: pos = 3,
   
Output: 3
Explanation: The loop is from 19 to 10. So length of loop is 19 → 33 → 10 = 3.
Input: pos = 0,
    
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no loop.
Constraints:
1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 105
1 ≤ node->data ≤ 104
0 ≤ pos < number of nodes

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLoop(self, head):
        #code here
        c = head
        d = set()
        ls = []
        while c:
            if c not in d:
               d.add(c)
               ls.append(c)
               c = c.next
            else:
                a = len(ls) - ls.index(c)
                return a
        return 0
